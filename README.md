## Hi!
My name is Oliver. I'm a web + game developer and 3D + graphic designer. I mainly use Illustrator and Blender for 2D and 3D design and for programming I use VS Code. I've been coding since around 2016.

## I currently write in the following languages:
- C++ (Arduino, my first text language)
- JavaScript (Node and web)
- HTML and CSS (web development)
- Luau (Roblox development)
- Lua (native lua projects)
- Python
- (Learning) C# for game development
