## Hi!
My name is Oliver B. I'm a web + game developer and 3D + graphic designer. I mainly use Illustrator and Blender for 2D and 3D design. For programming, I use VS Code. I've been coding for around 5 years now.

## I currently write in the following languages:
- C++ (Arduino, my first text language)
- JavaScript
- HTML and CSS (web development)
- Luau (Roblox development)
- Lua (native lua projects)
- Python
- (Learning) C# for game development

## Other stuff about me
- I own a video game company! https://arro.digital/
- My future goals are to ace Python, learn Ruby and C# and figure out how to use Unity
- I'm currently a front-end developer but maybe will do more back-end in the future
