Web + game developer and 3D + graphic designer. I mainly use Illustrator and Blender for 2D and 3D design and for programming I use VS Code. I've been coding since around 2016.

Haven't really been using GitHub as I use my own private git server now.

- HTML and CSS (web development)

NodeJS; clean syntax and includes OOP but not required. TypeScript is also awesome, but ES6 imports are kinda trash.
