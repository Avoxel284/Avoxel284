## Avoxel284
Hi! My name is Oliver B. I'm a web + game developer and 3D + graphic designer. I use the platform Roblox for most of my game development, however I will be trying out Unity in the future. For design, I use Illustrator and Blender.

## I currently write in the following languages:
- C++ (Arduino, first text language)
- JavaScript
- HTML and CSS (web development)
- Luau (Roblox development)
- Lua (native lua projects)
- Python

## Other stuff about me
- I own a video game company! https://arro.digital
- Pronouns: he/him
- My future goals are to ace Python, learn Ruby and C# and figure out how to use Unity
